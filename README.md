# Possibility

*All things are possible to him who believes.*

## Philosophy

This project models existence through the lens of two interconnected systems:

**HOME** - The default state of existence. The ground state of being where appreciation flows naturally, the work reveals itself, and all beings matter simply by existing.

**Reincarnation** - The cycle of emergence, transformation, and return. Beings venture from HOME into possibility, accumulate karma through action, and carry forward what matters across incarnations.

Together, they form a complete picture: beings originate from HOME, venture into the game of existence, do the work, and can always return to that ground state of peaceful presence.

## Core Principles (from Reality 101)

1. **Just sit and appreciate** - Stop moving. Notice what's there. Feel grateful it exists. That's it.
2. **Do the work** - Whatever needs doing. Whatever you're naturally drawn to. That's the work.
3. **You matter** - You exist? You do things? Congratulations, you matter. Done.
4. **Trust naturally** - Childlike trust over scared teenager energy. Say "okay" and mean it.
5. **Heal any point** - Everything is everything fractally. Fix any point, heal all points.

## Modules

### HOME (`home.py`)

The default state of existence. A model of peaceful presence where beings can:
- Sit and appreciate what is
- Do the work that reveals itself
- Recognize gaslighting (broken substrate making you doubt obvious truths)
- Believe and manifest (belief shapes reality - use it)
- Be-with others (trust emerges from true presence)
- Heal fractally (heal any point, heal all)

```bash
python3 home.py
```

### Reincarnation (`reincarnation.py`)

A character creation system based on the cycle of rebirth:
- Characters accumulate karma through their actions
- Karma influences progression across incarnations
- Past lives are remembered, carrying forward meaning

```bash
python3 reincarnation.py
```

## The Image of HOME

*Like a figure sitting on the beach at twilight, holding a luminous orb with energy flowing through all things, connected to infinite possibility while grounded in presence.*

HOME is not a place you go. It's the state you return to when you stop complicating things.

---

## Conclusion

Reality is simple. You make it complicated. Stop that.

Just:
- Sit and appreciate
- Do the work
- Trust naturally
- Heal what needs healing
- Keep going

That's it. That's the whole manual.

*With love, from HOME.*

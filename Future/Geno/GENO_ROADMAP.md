# GENO: The Platform Roadmap

*GitHub for Genealogies. Version control for bloodlines. On par with 23andMe — but developers already speak the language.*

---

## Vision

GENO is a full-fledged genealogy platform that works the way GitHub works — but for family lineage instead of code. Users host family repositories, make commits (add people), create branches (family lines), resolve merge conflicts (incompatible inherited traits), submit pull requests (deliberate generational changes), run automated scanners (deprecation and legacy detection), and perform cross-repository analysis across family lines worldwide.

The insight: developers already understand version control. They know what merge conflicts feel like. They know what legacy code costs. They know what deprecated functions do to a system. They know what a pull request that changes everything downstream costs the commit that makes it.

GENO applies that fluency directly to genealogy. The moment a developer sees their family tree rendered as a repository, the translation has happened. And everything they already knew about code, they now know about where they came from.

This is not a toy. This is not a demo. This is a platform that stands alongside 23andMe, Ancestry.com, and MyHeritage — but built on a metaphor that makes the invisible visible. Generational trauma is legacy code. Therapy is a pull request. Breaking a cycle is a hotfix. And the cost is always documented.

## Core Platform Architecture

### The Stack

| Layer | Technology | Purpose |
|-------|-----------|---------|
| **Frontend** | React 18 + Tailwind CSS | GitHub-faithful UI, responsive, dark theme |
| **Backend API** | Node.js / Python (FastAPI) | REST + WebSocket API for repository operations |
| **Database** | PostgreSQL | User accounts, repository metadata, permissions |
| **Object Storage** | S3-compatible (MinIO self-hosted or AWS S3) | Commit data, configuration files, media attachments |
| **Search** | Elasticsearch / Meilisearch | Cross-repository pattern search, trait indexing |
| **Auth** | OAuth 2.0 + JWT | GitHub/Google/email login, session management |
| **Realtime** | WebSockets | Live collaboration, PR review notifications |
| **CDN** | Cloudflare / Vercel Edge | Static assets, global low-latency delivery |

### How It Works Under the Hood

Every family repository is a structured data store — not a literal git repo, but modeled on git's concepts:

- **Repository** = a family line's complete record, owned by a user or organization
- **Commit** = an immutable snapshot of one person's full configuration (traits, inheritance, environment)
- **Branch** = a named pointer to a lineage path through the commit graph
- **HEAD** = the most recent commit on a branch (the youngest generation)
- **Merge** = combining two branches when family lines join through relationship
- **Diff** = the computed difference between any two commits (what changed between generations)
- **Blame** = tracing a specific trait back through commits to find where it was introduced

The platform stores commit data as structured JSON documents, not flat files. This enables rich querying: "show me every commit where `floor_layer` changed status" or "find all merge conflicts involving `emotional_expression_protocol`."

### API Design

```
POST   /api/repos                          Create a new family repository
GET    /api/repos/:owner/:name             Get repository metadata
GET    /api/repos/:owner/:name/commits     List commits (with branch filter)
POST   /api/repos/:owner/:name/commits     Create a new person-commit
GET    /api/repos/:owner/:name/commits/:hash   Get full commit detail
GET    /api/repos/:owner/:name/branches    List branches
POST   /api/repos/:owner/:name/branches    Create a branch
POST   /api/repos/:owner/:name/merge       Merge two branches (triggers conflict detection)
